# Learning Management System (LMS) Software Development Plan

This project outlines the **Software Development Plan** for the creation of a new **Learning Management System (LMS)** software. The goal of this software is to provide libraries with an easy and efficient way to manage patron information.

## Features
Through the development of this software, libraries will gain the ability to:
- **Create, delete, and display patron information.**
- Store patron data directly within the application.
- Interact with the application via an **On-Screen (ONS) Menu** in the **Command Line Interface (CLI).**

### User Actions (Librarians)
Librarians can perform the following actions:
1. Upload patron information using a `.txt` file.
2. Enter individual patron data manually.
3. Delete a patron from the application.
4. Display a list of all patrons.
5. Quit the application.
