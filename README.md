This work forms the software development plan in order to illustrate the development of a new LMS (Learning Management Application) software. Through the development of this software, any library will have an easy way of managing patron information. This program will be able to create, delete, or show all patrons. It is directly inputted and saved inside the application. Users will be able to communicate with the applications by an ONS (On-screen) menu from the CLI (Command Line Interface). Users (librarians) will then be able to choose any of the following options: upload patron information with a text (.txt) file, enter individual patron data, delete a patron from the application, display all patrons, or quit the application.
